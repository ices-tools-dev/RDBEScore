\title{Extract Functions and Descriptions from an R Package}
\usage{
listPackageFunctions(pkg)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{A character string or an unquoted name specifying the package from which to extract functions. The package must be installed and accessible.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns. The \code{Function} column lists the names of the functions found in the package. The \code{Description} column contains the brief descriptions extracted from each function’s documentation, and the \code{Exported} column is a logical vector indicating whether the function is exported from the package.
}
\description{
This function extracts the list of functions contained within a specified R package and retrieves a brief description for each function from the package documentation. The description is obtained by parsing the Rd file associated with each function to extract the text from the \code{\title} field. In addition, the function determines whether each function is exported from the package by comparing against the package’s exported names.
}
\details{
The function first accesses the package namespace using \code{asNamespace} and retrieves all objects using \code{ls}. It filters these objects to include only functions. For each function, the associated help file is retrieved using \code{utils::help} and the Rd file is extracted with \code{utils:::.getHelpFile}. The internal helper function \code{getRdTitle} is then used to parse the Rd object and extract the text in the \code{\title} field. Finally, the function assembles the output into a data frame that also includes an indicator of whether each function is exported.
