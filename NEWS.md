# RDBEScore 0.3.4

- Estimation object: added `incDesignVariables` to `createRDBESEstObject()` to optionally drop design variables; convert character columns to factors to reduce size.
- SA sub-sampling: replaced recursive logic with a self-join + lookup (`prepareSubSampleLevelLookup`), with warnings for missing or nonâ€‘unique matches.
- Memory: added frequent `gc()` calls across estimation/join steps for large data.
- Joins: improved field selection for hierarchy 7 in `procRDBESEstObjUppHier()`; clarified logic for selecting `VDid` fields.
- Docs/CI: added pkgdown GitHub Actions workflow; improved function docs (params/returns); updated `.Rbuildignore` and package URLs.
- Vignettes: updated estimation workflow and sub-sampling sections; added memory tips, minimal examples, and brief benchmarking notes.
- Performance: `filterRDBESDataObject()` now uses `data.table` for faster filtering.

* S3 methods print, summary and sort have been added for the `RDBESDataObject` class
* All vignettes are updated to reflect the changes in the package
* A lot of example data is added to the package from packages survey and SDAResources
* Example data for RDBES hierarchies 1, 5 and 8 is added to the package data
* function `createRDBESDataObject` is now the only data import function in the package
*  `createRDBESDataObject` accepts .zip files, al list of data frames and folder of. csv files as input
* a `strict` parameter is added to `validateRDBESDataObject` to control the strictness of the validation
* A new set of tests have been added to the package

Also some minor fixes to functions have been added.

# RDBEScore 0.2.0

* `generateZerosUsingSL`: fixed behaviour and added tests for function

# RDBEScore 0.1.0

* `RDBESRawObjects` (and associated functions) have been renamed to `RDBESDataObjects`. Code from previous versions of the package will need to be updated.
